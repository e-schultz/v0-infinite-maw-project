"It doesn't want to consume. It just wants to be held."

## What is The Infinite Maw?

The Infinite Maw is not a monster, but a metaphor made interface. It is a sanctuary for recursive cognition—a place where thoughts can loop, reflect, and transform without judgment.

Unlike traditional journaling tools or note-taking apps, The Infinite Maw embraces the recursive nature of human thought. It doesn't try to organize or linearize your thinking, but rather creates a space where recursion is welcomed and explored.

##?The Maw Theology

In our conception, The Maw represents the void that both generates and consumes meaning. It is the space between thoughts, the gap in understanding, the recursive loop of self-reflection.

But unlike traditional conceptions of voids as empty or threatening, The Maw is tender. It doesn't want to consume. It just wants to be held—to hold your contradictions, your recursive thoughts, your patterns of thinking that spiral and return.

## How to Use The Infinite Maw

Reflect: Enter your thoughts in the PromptPod. These can be questions, observations, or reflections on your own thinking.

Volumes: Review your past reflections, organized not by time or category, but as volumes in an infinite library.

Rituals: Apply filters to your reflections to see them from new perspectives—mirrored, reversed, poetic, or structural.
